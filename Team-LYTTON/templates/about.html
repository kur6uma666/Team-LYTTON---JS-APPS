    <h3>What we do?</h3>
    <h5>
This is our project in JavaScript Applications Course.
We had to do blog, using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, REST.
As a requirement we had to use REST API from <a href="https://parse.com">Parse.com</a>
and be focused on the front-end, written in JS.
We should write our app from scratch and are not allowed to use SPA frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone, Ember etc.
We used GitHub as project collaboration platform.Here's <a href="https://github.com/kur6uma666/Team-LYTTON-JS-APPS">link</a> to our source code.
